- Only AI forensic tool with real-world institutional court validation

✅ **Institution Partners** (permanent free access):
- South African Police Service (SAPS)
- South African Justice System
- Reason: They validated the forensic engine in actual court proceedings

✅ **Evidence Foundation**:
- All AI legal recommendations cite specific forensic evidence
- Citizens see source data and analysis
- Process approved by South African legal professionals
- Better than generic AI legal advice (backed by evidence)

✅ **Important Limitations**:
- Decision support, not legal representation
- Complex cases require professional attorney consultation
- Evidence prevents speculation but doesn't replace counsel
- Real trials require proper legal representation
- Local laws and jurisdiction rules apply
