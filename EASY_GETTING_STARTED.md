## Advanced: What Actually Happens (If You're Curious)

### The 9-Brain System

Verum Omnis uses a "9-brain" system that checks:

1. **Evidence Brain**: What do the documents say?
2. **Contradiction Brain**: What doesn't match?
3. **Timeline Brain**: What order did things happen?
4. **Jurisdiction Brain**: What are the rules where you live?
5. **Behavior Brain**: Are there patterns (like gaslighting)?
6. **Finance Brain**: Do money flows match the story?
7. **Communication Brain**: Do responses seem honest?
8. **Ethics Brain**: Is it fair and legal?
9. **Guardian Brain**: Does it protect you?

### Why This Matters
Each brain checks the evidence separately, then they all agree on the final answer.

This is why it's better than asking a regular AI about your case—this system was **validated in real court** (Case H208/25, Port Shepstone, South Africa).
